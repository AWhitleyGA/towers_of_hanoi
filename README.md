##Technologies Used

* Javascript
* CSS
* HTML

## Approach Taken

1. Define all desired user stories (features)
1. Categorize user stories into bronze (MVP), silver, and gold levels and develop functionality in ascending order
1. Develop user stories on separate, individually-assigned branches and merge complete, stable features into master branch (gh-pages)
1. Utilize Trello boards to keep track of completed/remaining user stories

## User Stories

### Bronze

* Users can click on a pole to select the top-most disk on it and a second destination pole to move the disk
* Users should be notified when they have won the game by move an entire stack of disks to a new pole and given option to reset game

### Silver

* When users select a pole, it should animate to indicate that it is selected
* Users are greeted by a welcome screen to explain the rules of the game
* Users can click a button to initialize and load up the game interface

### Gold

* Users time to complete the game should be recorded and medals of gold, silver, or bronze awarded based on these timeInMinutes
* Users should be able to cancel their selection of a pole by clicking on it again if done before selecting a destination pole

### Black (not achieved)

* Users can click a button to "give up" and have the computer finish the puzzle for them
